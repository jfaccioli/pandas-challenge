Description of at least two observable trends based on the data:

- At first, we can quickly observe a positive trend as the overall passing rate is higher than 50%, with better and very satisfaying results in reading (>85% passing).
However, an overall passing rate above 70% or 80% would be more satisfaying and means that some improvements can be done.
Maybe a better budget, maybe less student per school (and so more schools), maybe having more schools adapted to the student needs could help. 
Luckily, we have now some clean data to bring some answers...

- A quick look at our analysis shows that the type of school has a strong influence on the math scores especially, but also on the reading scores.
We can oberserve an overall passing rate at 90,4% for charter schools against 53,7% district schools.
A simple definition of charter schools (https://www.publiccharters.org/about-charter-schools/what-charter-school):
"Charter schools are independently-operated public schools that have the freedom to design classrooms that meet their studentsâ€™ needs"
If it goes further than that, here is probably a good explaination. The courses can be more adapted to each student, with maybe more time allowed when necessary, and probably more budget and higher result standards.

- Another key factor is the size of the school. Indeed, we observe very good results below 2000 students per school (89-90% overall passing) and average results between 2000 and 5000 students per school (58% overall passing).

- Surprisingly, lower the spending range per student is, better the overall passing rate is.
Probably, the smaller charter schools don't need a big budget as there is less extra costs needed, maybe less infrastructures or extra support for students with personnal problems.

We can conclude that the type of school and the size are the main key for successful students (charter and medium-small schools), and at a lower cost!
